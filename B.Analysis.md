- With more than 3,000 courses in 7 years, from the 'Courses By year' table we can see that the courses have increased quite steadily in the first 7 years (2011-2017). 
- However, in 2017, the number of classes still increased in number, but the number of students participating and the number of reviews is decreasing (down 74.54% for Q2). 

-> This could be because the courses are going down in quality, so the number of participants and reviews are dropping significantly, or it could be that the more popular emergence of other live learning platforms like Coursera has affected.

# 3. Paid or Free

- In Overall, Paid courses account for more than 90% of all courses opened within 7 years (2011-2017) and this percentage has not changed too much from year to year.

- Starting from 2011 with more than 100,000 students registered for paid courses. 
  - In the next periods, from 2012 - 2014, the proportion of students participating in free and paid classes is almost the same, there is no big difference in this period. 
  - However, after 2015-2017, the number of students paying fees has surpassed the number of students participating in free classes, 
  - Ex: 2015: 2.5 million paying students vs 740,000 students participating for free .

- In the period 2015 -2017, the average amount of money that students are willing to pay for a class has also increased steadily (from $48/class in 2014, to $66/class in 2015, similar to $69/class). and $75/class in 2016 and 2017.

--> This proves that Udemy has had more quality classes and attracted more students to attend paid classes from 2015 onwards. However, by 2017, it seems that the number of students participating is quite low, including free and paid classes.

- Of the 3672 courses that have been opened, Web Development and Business Finance courses account for the majority with more than 65% of the total subjects.

- Regarding the hierarchy of courses, All-Levels accounted for more than 50% with 1925 courses opened, followed by Beginner Level and Intermediate Level respectively with more than 1.2 thousand courses and 421 courses respectively. In the end only about 58 courses for Expert level were opened in 7 years. Similarly, the total amount that All Levels courses also earned is the highest with more than 600 million US dollars

- Number of students taking the majority of Web Development courses at all levels. Especially Levels for everyone (All Levels) with nearly 4 million registered users.

- The total amount and revenue of each Web Development course is also the highest at $0.63 billion and the average revenue per course is over $500 thousand.

# 5. Final Comments

- It can be seen that Udemy in 7 years (2011-2017) has had a fairly stable development.
  - Expanded many different courses with a variety of fields.
  - More paid courses have been opened. Increase both quality and quantity.
  - Students are willing to pay more for classes on Udemy
  - Web Development courses and All Level courses are always the most popular and profitable courses for Udemy.

- However, the first two quarters of 2017 saw a significant setback compared to the same period last year. The reason may lie in the quality of the courses that did not meet the needs of the students, the courses were copied and sold on other platforms. Or it can also be due to the strong development of other platforms Eg: Coursera.

- ðŸš© So, I believe that Udemy should:
  - Focus more on quality courses in other subjects to expand the student population. Change and update learning difficulties with better quality, update knowledge.
  - Continue to strengthen the foundation of Web Development courses. Especially about the development trend of science and technology, Udemy should open more courses on Computer Technology and Data.
