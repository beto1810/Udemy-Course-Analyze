# 1. Overview 

<img width="1076" alt="image" src="https://github.com/beto1810/Udemy-Course-Analyze/assets/101379141/88601334-c902-469a-89a6-f9c76e0b72bd">

- There have been 3622 courses opened with more than 11 million registered students.

- In total, 144 thousand lessons have been provided to students and more than 574 thousand reviews have been received within years of operation.

- Udemy's total revenue for the period 2011-2017 was $858 million.


- With more than 3,000 courses in 5 years, from the 'Courses By year' chart we can see that the courses have increased quite steadily. 
- However, in the period after 2015, the number of classes still increased in number, but the number of students participating, the number of reviews and total revenue by year experienced a decreasing. 

-> This could be because the courses are going down in quality, so the number of participants and reviews are dropping significantly, or it could be that the more popular emergence of other live learning platforms like Coursera has affected. 

-> Beside the external causes, we would like to discuss more about the internal resources basing on the Udemy's Courses data.

# 2. Paid or Free

<img width="1073" alt="image" src="https://github.com/beto1810/Udemy-Course-Analyze/assets/101379141/5a7789bf-d4a1-4ca2-9f06-2d89c49bf811">

- In Overall, Paid courses account for about 90% of all courses opened within 5 years (2013-2017) and this percentage has not changed too much from year to year.

  - In the period between 2013 and 2014, the proportion of students participating in free and paid classes is almost the same, there is no big difference in this period. 
  - However, after 2015-2017, the number of students paying fees has surpassed the number of students participating in free classes, 
  - Ex: 2015: 2.5 million paying students vs 740,000 students participating for free .

- In the period 2015 -2017, the average amount of money that students are willing to pay for a class has also increased steadily (from $48/class in 2014, to $66/class in 2015, similar to $69/class). and $75/class in 2016 and 2017.

--> This proves that Udemy has had more quality classes and attracted more students to attend paid classes in 2015. However, by 2016, it seems that the number of students participating is decreasing. The cause seemed to be the increasing the price of paid courses, but the speed of price increasing is not high (5% for 2015-> 2016) to impact to the subsciber's selection.

# 3. Subject 

<img width="1042" alt="image" src="https://github.com/beto1810/Udemy-Course-Analyze/assets/101379141/bcad5c52-6fa9-40b9-8829-0a5718f56e97">

- Out of a total of 3,672 courses offered, Web Development and Business Finance courses dominate, making up more than 65% of all subjects.

- The Web Development course stands out in terms of both subscribers and revenue, boasting over 8 million subscribers and generating a staggering $0.63 billion in revenue.

- Although the number of Web Development and Business Finance courses is quite similar, the Web Development courses have four times as many subscribers. In 2017, the price of each Finance course caught up to the price of Web Development courses. This suggests that either the Business Finance course may not have effectively attracted learners, or it's possible that the cost of these Finance courses is excessively high.

# 4. Course' Level

<img width="1064" alt="image" src="https://github.com/beto1810/Udemy-Course-Analyze/assets/101379141/11f4d2f4-7aa5-44d6-9c26-339289f32d0d">

- The course hierarchy on Udemy is categorized into four levels, with "All-Levels" being the most extensive, consisting of 1,925 courses, which is more than 50% of the total. Following this, we have "Beginner Level" with over 1.2 thousand courses and "Intermediate Level" with 421 courses. Surprisingly, only around 58 courses are available at the "Expert Level."

- "All Levels" courses have attracted a substantial user base of 4 million registered users, which accounts for over 50% of all subscribers. However, it's worth noting that the number of subscribers for these courses is declining rapidly, surpassing the growth trends seen in the three lower-level categories. This suggests that learners are leaving the Udemy platform, possibly because the advanced level courses no longer align with their learning progress.

- Udemy's statistics indicate an increase in the number of Intermediate level courses, but the quality of these courses remains questionable. Moreover, the availability of Expert level courses is limited, which could further impact the platform's ability to cater to the needs of learners seeking more advanced education.

# 5. Final Comments

- Over a span of five years from 2013 to 2017, Udemy experienced relatively stable growth. They expanded their course offerings across various fields, with an increasing number of paid courses that improved both in quantity and quality. Moreover, it's evident that students were willing to invest more in Udemy courses, indicating a positive trend.

- Web Development courses and All-Level courses consistently remained the most popular and lucrative courses for Udemy during this period.

- However, it's essential to note that the first two quarters of 2017 marked a significant setback compared to the same period in the previous year. This dip could be attributed to various factors, including the quality of courses not meeting students' expectations, the unauthorized replication and sale of courses on other platforms, or the emergence of strong competitors like Coursera.


ðŸš© So, I believe that Udemy should:
  - Emphasize the development of high-quality courses in a wider range of subjects to attract a broader student base. This involves continually updating content to ensure it aligns with current learning needs and standards.

  - Place a special focus on strengthening the Web Development course offerings, particularly in response to evolving trends in science and technology. Expanding into areas like Computer Technology and Data courses can help Udemy maintain its competitive edge and cater to the growing demand in these fields.
 
  - Improve user feedback and rating systems to help students make more informed decisions about course selection. This can also help instructors gain valuable insights for course improvement.
